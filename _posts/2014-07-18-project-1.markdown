description: The aim of this project was to calculate an Influencer-Based Return rate, which would quantify the value add of an influencer or celebrity to a campaign or company. My team and I used clustering techniques and social network analysis (using <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>) to identify which followers are of most value. We also developed a web based persona-generation app called <a href="personify-ibr.herokuapp.com">Personify</a> that can build a persona for a group of users based on their tweets.
