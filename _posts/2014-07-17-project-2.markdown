description: My team and I used NLP techniques and search engine models to creat a smart AI bot. This bot can be fed multiple files - wiki entries, newspaper articles, school text - and it can generate questions based on the text. It also answers any questions asked to it about the data that has been fed to it.
  Our bot achieved an accuracy of 80% in answering questions. A short video of our methodology can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdR6ornHoc">here</a> 
  This has applications in education - in the form of automated test generation, customer service - by answering frequently asked questions customers may have, and much more.
