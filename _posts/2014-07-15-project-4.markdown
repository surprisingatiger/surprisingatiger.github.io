description: I worked with Tensorflow and R to predict bushfire occurrence in Australia. I performed data extraction and synthesis on weather and topographical datasets from the states of New South Wales and South Australia, and with data from 3 fires. Using this, I built a supervised Recurrent Neural Network model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory cells). This model achieved an accuracy of 85%.
